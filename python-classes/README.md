# Pyhton - Classes and objects

- In this project, we'll go over classes and objects:

```py
   # class 
   class human:
        def __init__(self, name, lastName):
            self.name = name
            self.lastName = lastName


    # object
    human1 = human("Juan", "Ramirez")
    print(human1.name)
    print(human1.lastName)
```
